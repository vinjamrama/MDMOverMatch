Title: Understanding Informatica MDM Overmatch and Undermatch Issues
Subtitle: Strategies for Effective Data Management
Introduction to Informatica MDM:

Informatica MDM (Master Data Management) is a comprehensive approach to enable organizations to link all critical data to a single master file, providing a common point of reference.
Example: A multinational corporation uses Informatica MDM to manage customer data across various departments and regions, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
What are Overmatch and Undermatch?

Overmatch occurs when disparate records are incorrectly merged into a single entity, leading to data loss and inaccuracies.
Undermatch refers to the failure to identify and link related records, resulting in duplicate entries and fragmented data.
Example: In a healthcare organization, overmatch could merge patient records with similar but distinct names, leading to incorrect medical histories. Undermatch might result in duplicate patient entries across different hospital branches.
Causes of Overmatch and Undermatch:

Data quality issues such as incomplete or inconsistent data entry.
Lack of standardization in data formats and values across systems.
Duplicates present in source systems due to legacy data migrations.
Example: In a retail company, overmatch could occur due to variations in product naming conventions, while undermatch might result from incomplete address information leading to multiple customer profiles for the same individual.
Challenges in Identifying Overmatch and Undermatch:

Large volumes of data across disparate systems make it challenging to maintain data consistency.
Complex data relationships make it difficult to accurately identify matching records.
Example: A financial institution struggles with identifying overmatch and undermatch issues across multiple databases housing customer information, resulting in discrepancies in account balances and customer profiles.
Consequences of Overmatch and Undermatch:

Erroneous analytics and reporting can lead to flawed business decisions.
Loss of customer trust due to inaccuracies in personal data and interactions.
Compliance and regulatory risks due to incorrect data handling.
Example: A telecommunications company faces regulatory penalties due to undermatch issues leading to incomplete customer identity verification processes, violating data protection regulations.
Strategies for Resolving Overmatch and Undermatch:

Data Profiling and Cleansing:
Example: Implementing Informatica's data quality tools to cleanse and standardize customer address data, reducing undermatch issues caused by variations in address formats.
Matching and Deduplication:
Example: Configuring Informatica MDM's matching rules to accurately identify duplicate customer records based on attributes such as name, address, and phone number.
Data Governance:
Example: Establishing a data stewardship program to review and resolve ambiguous match results, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
Continuous Improvement:
Example: Conducting regular data quality audits and soliciting feedback from end-users to refine matching algorithms and improve data accuracy over time.
Case Studies:

Example: A global insurance company reduced undermatch issues by 30% and improved customer satisfaction scores by implementing Informatica MDM's data quality and matching capabilities.
Best Practices for Preventing Overmatch and Undermatch:

Example: Standardizing data entry processes and providing training to employees to ensure consistent and accurate data input.
Example: Implementing data governance policies to enforce data quality standards and monitor compliance across the organization.
Conclusion:

Emphasize the importance of proactive data management in mitigating overmatch and undermatch issues to ensure accurate decision-making and regulatory compliance.
